# Ponder This solutions by Knue

My personal history of the codes to produce solutions for [IBM's monthly Ponder This puzzles](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis).

I'm most happy that Andreas Stiller made me share his enthusiasm about this in April 2017. It is a nice and exciting pastime that let me learn many interesting new things about math and programming that I most probably wouldn't have otherwise.

I'll post solutions and source codes that I'll manage always after the month is over.
