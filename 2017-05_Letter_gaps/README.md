# 2017-05: Letter Gaps

[The May puzzle](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/challenges/Mai2017.html) asked for a string with two occurrences of each letter A to Z where there is 1 other letter between the As, two other letters between the Bs and so on. One needs one extra character.

This is a nice task for backtracking. It turns out there are very many solutions. So you probably want to CRTL+C after a couple of tenthousand solutions.
