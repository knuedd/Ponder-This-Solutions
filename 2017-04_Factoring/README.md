# 2017-04: Factoring

[This puzzle](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/challenges/April2017.html) seems easy enough in retrospect but finding the idea that gcd was the way to go ... Their hint, that only little CPU time was sufficient was added later but here I had heard Andreas Stiller's comment that it was so easy. I tried brute force in the beginning, then tried clever ways of brute force, looked for hints at which special numbers to start with brute force attempts over several days. It was pointless, though.

It was completely clear to me that the quantum computing cover story was not to be taken seriously. Still, I started reading the referenced paper about [Shor's algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9508027v2) out of sheer frustration. On the first page I read "gcd" and I knew that was it. What a moment.
